Provides full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. Relatively
new technology. The most concrete thing it enables is "push/pull" server
communication. Instead of using an older method like long polling, the server
can dynamically push messages to the client through an open TCP channel.
SocketIO is a popular implementation.
