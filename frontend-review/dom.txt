Domain Object Model - It's a convention for organizing and interacting with
elements inside of an HTML document.

Nodes are organized into a tree structure. Nodes in this tree can be
manipulated by calling methods on those objects.

Basic high level structure: Window>Document>Form

Browsers have HTML engines whose purpose is to convert HTML into a DOM.
