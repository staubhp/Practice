Web Components: Reusable UI widgets made from open web technologies. Standard
created by Google. The biggest thing here is it's a standardized way to
encapsulate presentation details in an HTML document. Prior to this, styling
elements that you only intended for a specific widget could spill over and
effect the entire DOM.

Consists of:
	- Custom Elements
	- HTML Templates
	- Shadow DOM
	- HTML Imports

New Stuff:
	- HTML elements: <template> <content> <shadow>
	- API for registering elements: Document.registerElement()

Shadow DOM:
	- Encapsulates JS, CSS and templating for a web component.
	- Separates the main DOM from the element's DOM
	- element.createShadowRoot()
